        <h3>Computer Science Engineering</h3>
        <p>My three primary interests and passions are Computer Science,
            Mathematics and Robotics and I believe that there is a creative
            fusion between all these disciplines. I engage wholeheartedly in
            these areas both in my school courses and out of school and
            hope that I will be able to continue doing so on my chosen
            course and in the extra-curricular opportunities at university.
